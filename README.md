# Redux Router Chat

Refactoring of [Redux Chat](https://github.com/clairefro/chat-redux) using redux-router for shareable channel URLs.

---------------------------------------------------
Simple React + Redux chat app styled a la Slack, with emoji compatibility via [react-emojione](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-emojione). 

Uses [Le Wagon's chat API](https://github.com/lewagon/wagon-chat-api) to store/retrieve messages, so your chat is public with others in the same channel. Note: message database is cleared every hour or so.
